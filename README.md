# MAGD-150-P5JS-Project
This contains 3 p5js coding projects I created throughout the semester.
These projects are extremely basic as I did not have much experience with coding at the time of creating these.


# Pudroski, Assignment 2
This is my project for week 2 of the class. It features a cloudy sky as the backgroud with 3 geometric balloons drifting into the sky, one of these balloons has disconnected from the group.

# Pudroski_Week3
This is my project for week 3 of the class. It features a gray background with 3 groups of rectangles, each group being different colors and tilted at different angles. It also contains code to track your mouse position on the screen, it connects a line from a set point and to the mouse and will give you the amount of pixels the mouse is away from the lines origin point. The frame rate is also set to 15 in the project. 

# Pudroski_Week4
This is my project for week 4 of class. It contains a gray background with 6 black lines, one line is vertically placed in the middle. When the 'n' key is held the screen turns black and a white circle appears. When the 'h' key is held the background turns to white, and a black unfilled circle appears above the vertical line.
